## 1. Description <a id="descrip"> </a>
ReduxShop is an online shopping application using MERN stack, GraphQL, JWT authentication, Redux  and stripe for e-payment. Redux is an npm package which allows for global state variables to be used on the client side. It uses a redux store to collect all the reducers and then dispatches these to any of the components in the React tree on the client side.
